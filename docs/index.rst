Welcome to the hstaxe package documentation!
============================================

`hstaxe` is a Python package to extract spectra from all
slitless spectroscopy modes provided by the 
`Hubble Space Telescope <https://www.stsci.edu/hst>`_ 
`Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) <https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/wfc3>`_
and the `Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) <https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/acs>`_.
It supports the features provided by the previous IRAF-based aXe package.

.. note::
   This documentation mostly overlaps with, but is not identical to, the original
   aXe manual. The last version of the aXe manual can be downloaded from
   `the hstaxe repository <https://github.com/spacetelescope/hstaxe/tree/main/docs/aXe_manual/axe-user-manual-v-2-3.pdf>`_.
