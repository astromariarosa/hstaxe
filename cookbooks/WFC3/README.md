**In order to run these Jupyter Notebooks, you must create a virtual environment
using the `cookbook_env.yml` file provided in the [cookbook folder](https://github.com/spacetelescope/hstaxe/tree/main/cookbooks).** Once
the `.yml` file is in the current working directory, the environment can be
built using the command below:

`conda env create -f cookbook_env.yml`
