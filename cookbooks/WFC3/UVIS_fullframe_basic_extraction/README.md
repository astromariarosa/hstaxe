In this Jupyter Notebook tutorial, we present the workflow for performing a
basic spectral extraction using WFC3/UVIS G280 data with the HSTaXe software.

This directory, once cloned/downloaded, should contain this README.md, the
tutorial Jupyter Notebook `wfc3-basic-uvis-fullframe-hstaxe-cookbook.ipynb`, an
a `.HTML` copy of the notebook. In the `.HTML` version of the notebook each cell
has been run and the corresponding output is shown.

**In order to run this Jupyter Notebook, you must create a virtual
environment using the `cookbook_env.yml` file provided in the root HSTaXe
repository.** Once you have the `.yml` file in your current working directory you
can build the environment using the command below:

`conda env create -f cookbook_env.yml`
